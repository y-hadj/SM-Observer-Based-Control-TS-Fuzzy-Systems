## Project Description
This repository presents the work of a seminar combining Sliding Mode Observation and Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Modeling. The control signal, of type LQR in this case, is based on the results of the state observations on the fuzzy model.
Fuzzy models are known to form a precise image of NL systems, and SM observers are also known for their robustness. An application is done on the Inverted Double Pendulum attached to a Forward-Moving Cart.


## Project Contents
The project includes the following components:

- **Seminar Report:** A PDF report containing the detailed theory involved in this work and practical examples for each notion. You can access it [here](./sem_report.pdf).

- **Cart-Pendulum Application:** A MATLAB source code and a Simulink simulation file that presents an applied LQR command on the TS fuzzy model of this complex NL system, based on an SM observation. You can access the source code [here](./cart_pend_script.m) and the simulation file [here](./cart_pend_simulation.slx).

- **TS modeling Example:** An example illustrating the huge precision of the TS approach for constructing a fuzzy model of a NL system. You can access the source code [here](./TS_modling_script.m) and the simulation file [here](./TS_modling_simulation.slx).
