## Project Description
This repository presents the work of a seminar combining Sliding Mode Observation and Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Modling. The control signal, in this case is of type LQR, is based on the results of the state observations on the fuzzy model.
Fuzzy models are a precise image of a NL system and a SM observation is a robust control for almost every type of systems. An application is done on the Inverted Double Pendulum attached to a Forward-Moving Cart.


## Project Contents
The project includes the following components:

- **Seminar Report:** A PDF report containing all the detailed theory that was involved in this work, as well as practical examples for each notion. You can acess it [here](./sem_report.pdf).

- **Cart-Pendulum Application:** A MATLAB source code and a Simulink simulation file that presents an applied LQR command on the TS fuzzy model of this complex NL system, based on a SM observation. You can acess the source code [here](./cart_pend_script.m) and the simulation file [here](./cart_pend_simulation.slx).

- **TS modeling Example:** An example illustrating the huge precision of the TS approach for constructing a fuzzy model of a NL system. You can acess the source code [here](./TS_modling_script.m) and the simulation file [here](./TS_modling_simulation.slx).
